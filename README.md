# Gpt for Uds

This project aims to make ChatGPT more accessible for application developers by having a daemon running in the background exposing a Unix Domain Socket file that other applications can use to interact with ChatGPT without having to do any api calls themself.

Please note that this is not even a proof of concept at this point in time.

If you want to contribute I'm open for anything.
